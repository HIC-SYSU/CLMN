# Requirement
```
Pytorch 1.6.0;  Python = 3.6
```

# Data Preparation
## RGB SOD
Training Set: We use the training set of DUTS to train our CRTINet. 

Testing Set: We use the testing set of DUTS, ECSSD, HKU-IS, PASCAL-S, and DUT-O to test our CRTINet.

## RGB-D SOD
Training Set: We follow previous studies to use the same 800 samples from DUT-RGBD, 700 samples from NLPR, and 1485 samples from NJUD for model training.

Testing Set: We use the testing set of NJUD, NLPR, DUTLF-RGBD, STERE-1000, and SIP to test our CRTINet.
